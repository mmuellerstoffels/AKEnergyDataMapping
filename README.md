# AKEnergyDataMapping
This set of code crawls across akenergygateway.alaska.edu and retrieves some information directly from the HTML sites. This is meant as a demo of retrieving data from the web where no database access is available. 

The retrieved data is stored in an SQLite DB and can be extracted into a JSON compatible with a website that uses the Google Maps JavaScript API to display place specific data. 

The origin of this project is the Capstone project to the Coursera course Python for Everyone (Module 5) by Charlse Severance, University of Michigan.
